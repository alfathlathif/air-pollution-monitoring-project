# Air Pollution Monitoring

Previously, I would like to express my gratitude to my groupmates who have built the air pollution monitoring hardware, namely Gayantri Yonga, Aldrian Bachtiar, and Raihan Ananda. Additionally, I would also like to thank my friend who has assisted me in completing this project, Abdurahman Basyah.
